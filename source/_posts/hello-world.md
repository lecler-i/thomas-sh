title: Hello World !

This is my personnal website, that I will use as portfolio and to post random articles on the blog section of it.

I build it using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), a javascript framework to build static websites from mardown mostly.

You can find the source code of this website on gitub : [lecler-i/thomas.sh](https://github.com/lecler-i/thomas.sh)

It is hosted on GithubPages and deployed automaticly using Travis-ci.
